## ðŸš© Introduction

These latex templates can be used "as is" in Overleaf and provide good starting points. *Report* and *Specification document* are very similar, the latter being lighter and more compact. 

### Features

- Nice title page with school logo, project info and project logo
- Code highlighting
- "Abstract" page
- "Authors" page
- Table of contents
- Header and footer with project information
- Glossary (acronyms and terms)
- Bibliography
